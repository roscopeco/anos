A toy operating system I'm using as a vehicle for learning more about
the low level, figuring out things I skipped last time (like long mode)
and really getting to grips with things I just copy-pasted from other
people (like paging).

This time, I'm copy-pasting nothing. I'm trying (with varying degrees
of success to be honest) to not even _look_ at other people's code - 
as much as possible I'm just going from official reference materials.
