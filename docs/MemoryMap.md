### Low Memory

Various bits of low memory are used. Some of them are only used
during the boot process and are reused later.

Some of these can be changed at build time (with e.g. `STAGE_2_ADDR`
defines) but probably shouldn't unless you know what you're doing
and have reasons for doing it...

During early boot (until the kernel sets up proper page tables for
the first time) there's some risky bits - stacks are _theoretically_
unbounded for example (but in reality never grow down beyond maybe
128 bytes or so at maximum).

The following are **physical** addresses:

| Start                | End                  | Use                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `------------------` | `0x0000000000007bff` | Stage 1/2 (un)real mode stack (actually only about 20 bytes) |
| `0x0000000000007c00` | `0x0000000000007dff` | Bootsector / Stage 1                                         |
| `0x0000000000007e00` | `0x000000000000a200` | FAT buffer (only during stage 1 file search)                 | 
| `0x0000000000008400` | `0x0000000000009bff` | BIOS E820h memory map (passed to kernel by stage2)           |
| `0x000000000000a400` | `0x000000000000ffff` | Stage 2 load area (max 23k, doesn't use it all)              |
| `------------------` | `0x000000000009bfff` | Stage 2 Protected stack (probably pointless moving it here..)|
| `0x000000000009c000` | `0x000000000009cfff` | Inital PML4 set up in stage2 init_pagetables.asm             |
| `0x000000000009d000` | `0x000000000009dfff` | Inital PDPT set up in stage2 init_pagetables.asm             |
| `0x000000000009e000` | `0x000000000009efff` | Inital PD set up in stage2 init_pagetables.asm               |
| `0x000000000009f000` | `0x000000000009ffff` | Inital PT set up in stage2 init_pagetables.asm               |

### Kernel Physical Mem (after stage2 is done)

These memory areas are reserved, and not added into the pool managed by the PMM.

| Start                | End                  | Use                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0x0000000000008400` | `0x0000000000009bff` | BIOS E820h memory map (passed to kernel by stage2, SEE BELOW)|
| `0x0000000000099000` | `0x0000000000099fff` | PMM Bootstrap page (Region struct and bottom of stack)       |
| `0x000000000009a000` | `0x000000000009afff` | PMM Area bootstrap page directory                            |
| `0x000000000009b000` | `0x000000000009bfff` | PMM Area bootstrap page table                                |
| `0x000000000009c000` | `0x000000000009cfff` | Inital PML4 set up in stage2 init_pagetables.asm             |
| `0x000000000009d000` | `0x000000000009dfff` | Inital PDPT set up in stage2 init_pagetables.asm             |
| `0x000000000009e000` | `0x000000000009efff` | Inital PD set up in stage2 init_pagetables.asm               |
| `0x000000000009f000` | `0x000000000009ffff` | Inital PT set up in stage2 init_pagetables.asm               |
| `0x0000000000100000` | `0x000000000010ffff` | Initial 64KiB long-mode stack (set up by stage 2 for kernel) |
| `0x0000000000110000` | `0x000000000011ffff` | 64KiB Kernel BSS                                             |
| `0x0000000000120000` | `0x00000000001fffff` | 896KiB Kernel load area                                      |

The `0x8400-0x9bff` space is reused for the AP startup trampoline, which is done after the memory map has
been processed during early startup. Once AP startup is in progress, that area looks like:

| Start                | End                  | Use                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0x0000000000001000` | `0x0000000000004fff` | AP trampoline bootstrap code (real -> long mode)             |
| `0x0000000000005000` | `0x0000000000005fff` | AP trampoline Data / BSS - kernel passes data to and from    |
| `0x0000000000006000` | `0x00000000000d5fff` | AP initial stacks (2KiB each AP for now)                     |

This area remains reserved until AP startup is fully complete and the scheduler has been initialized on
all APs - until that time, this area will still be in use for stacks (at least).

These ranges are defined in `realmode.ld` (and repeated in `startup.c` so if you change them, keep them
in step or you're likely to experience sadness).

### Long Mode Initial Page Table Layout

Once long mode gets set up, the platform- and loader-specific bootstraps
set up a few mappings in the initial page tables:

| Start                | End                  | Use                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0x0000000000000000` | `0x0000000000200000` | Identity mapped to physical bottom 2MiB (**x86_64 only**)    |
| `0xffffffff80000000` | `0xffffffff803fffff` | Kernel code / data static mapping (4MiB)                     |
| `0xffffffff82000000` | `0xffffffff827fffff` | Framebuffer (**UEFI only**, all platforms)                   |

This mapping lets the long mode setup keep running as it was (in the identity-mapped space),
up until it jumps directly to the kernel at it's (virtual) load address (in the kernel space
mapping). This happens at the end of the platform-specific bootstrap.

We also create the mapping for the 128GiB reserved address space for the PMM
structures at this point, leaving us with:

| Start                | End                  | Use                                                          |

| `0x0000800000000000` | `0xffff7fffffffffff` | [_Non-canonical memory hole_]                                |

#### Notes on specific areas

##### Virtual mapping area

We reserve the first available 127TiB of kernel space for the virtual mapping area. 
This area covers 254 PML4 entries from 256 to 509, leaving one entry (510) unused
and available for per-platform requirements, with the last entry (covering 512GB)
free for the rest of kernel space.

###### x86_64

On x86_64, this area holds a 1:1 direct map of all physical RAM in the system, as
detected at boot. This region is used by the virtual-memory subsystem for pagetable
management, and can also be used by other subsystems that need to directly 
maniu

The downsides of course are that all physical memory is mapped statically in
the kernel. It also means we have to maintain tables for all of these mappings
(but we do endeavour to use the largest possible page mappings for these areas
to minimise the overhead).

###### RISC-V

RISC-V page tables are not amenable to recursive mapping, since a table entry
cannot be both an intermediate and leaf table at the same time, so on this 
platform the design was always going to be direct-mapping.

##### ACPI tables

> [!WARNING]
> This section applies to **x86_64 only**.

> [!NOTE]
> This section remains accurate on UEFI systems (booted via Limine) - we drop Limine's
> mappings super early and remap these tables according to our own scheme.

ACPI tables are mapped into a small (8-page currently) reserved space. Once usermode is
up this will be remapped read-only, and made available for mapping into the the userspace
driver management subsystem's address space via a syscall.

| Start                | End                  | Use                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0xffffffff81000000` | `0xffffffff81008000` | Reserved space for ACPI tables                               |

Probably worth noting that these aren't moved or copied - they stay at their original 
phys location, and I just map it in. Maybe a bad idea, but works for now (on emus).

##### Per-CPU temporary mapping pages

Each CPU (up to a maximum of 256) has a single 4KiB page in this area that can be used for
a temporary mapping (e.g. when a single page needs to be copied without mapping in a whole
other address space).

Each CPU's page is at `0xFFFFFFFF80400000 + (CPU_ID << 12)`. There are no spinlocks 
protecting these (since they're per-CPU) but they should only be used with local
interrupts disabled for obvious reasons.

This is currently used for mapping new pages for COW pages in the pagefault handler.

| Start                | End                  | Use                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0xFFFFFFFF80400000` | `0xFFFFFFFF80FFFFFF` | 256 Per-CPU temporary mapping pages                          |

This space is not represented by page tables at boot, but if there's a page
fault there the handler will automatically map in a page. 

##### Hardware mappings

> [!WARNING]
> This section applies to **x86_64 only**. It needs to be updated for RISC-V
> as the implementation progresses.

The local APIC is mapped to:

| Start                | End                  | Use                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0xffffffa000000000` | `0xffffffa0000003ff` | Local APIC (for all CPUs)                                    |

This, again, won't be staying there, but it works for now. It'll eventually
get moved into:

| Start                | End                  | Use                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0xffffffff81008000` | `0xffffffff810fffff` | Kernel driver MMIO mapping space                             |

This area (of 248 pages, or 992KiB) is specifically reserved for mapping the
basic kernel drivers (the ones in `kdrivers/`). Allocation is handled in 
`kdrivers/drivers.c` with a simple check and increment - there's no ability
to free pages here (because there's no expectation we'll ever unmap these 
basic drivers once they're mapped in).

#### Kernel memory areas

The following areas are reserved for allocation of various forms within 
the kernel.

##### Fixed-block space

The following space is reserved for the fixed block allocator (and is where
the slab allocator will map blocks).

| Start                | End                  | Use                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0xffffffffc0000000` | `0xffffffffffffffff` | 1GiB FBA space                                               |

The fixed-block allocator works on 4KiB page granularity, so supports a 
maximum of 262144 blocks within this 1GiB space. Of those, the first eight
are used for metadata (a 32KiB bitmap tracking virtual address allocation
for this area) meaning there can be a maximum of 262136 blocks mapped into
this virtual area (the first eight are of course always mapped).

A gigabyte _feels_ like a lot, but we have the address space and I don't
feel like painting myself into any corners just now...

#### Notes / Future Plans

> [!WARNING]
> This section applies to **x86_64 only**.

This is all fun and games, but will almost certainly be a problem later 
(i.e. the kernel being stuck at <1MiB size and located at the ~1MiB mark in physical 
RAM on x86_64).

In the future it'll make sense to make things more robust, and maybe 
just load the kernel somewhere above 16MiB physical and map accordingly
(Kernel space can still map broadly the same - it might be useful to have
the first 16MiB mapped at the start of kernel space ðŸ¤”).

_Maybe_ I'd check we actually have >16MiB first, but are there even any 
x86_64s that have less RAM than that? ðŸ¤·
