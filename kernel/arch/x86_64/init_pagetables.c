/*
 * stage3 - Kernel page table initialisation
 * anos - An Operating System
 *
 * Now we're into the kernel proper, we no longer need the identity
 * mapping that was set up by the bootloader. We also need to set
 * up some mappings to support the PMM stack and other kernel
 * things.
 *
 * This expects that the page-tables are currently the mimimal ones
 * set up by the bootloader (see stage2/init_pagetables.asm).
 *
 * This doesn't move (or replace entirely) the tables - the PML4,
 * PDPT and PD for the top 2GiB will stay where they are. They
 * will be changed, however:
 *
 * * The PML4 entry mapping the bottom of the address space will be removed
 * * The PDPT entry mapping the bottom of the address space will be removed
 *
 * In both the above, the entries that map the first 2MiB physical
 * to the start of the top 2GiB will be left alone, since that's where
 * the kernel is going to live (and where this code is running from, so
 * changing it would be ... a mistake üòÖ).
 *
 * * A new PDPT entry mapping the bottom part of the top PML4 will be added
 *
 * This is where the PMM stack will live - I'm reserving the bottom 128GiB
 * of the top 512GiB (so, the top PML4) for this - starting at
 * 0xFFFFFF8000000000.
 *
 * This seems excessive, but will allow supporting up to 128TiB RAM, even in
 * the worst case of it being fully fragmented. Address-space is cheap,
 * so why not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (and to be fair, this might not be a long-term
 * solution, but it does the job for now...)
