/*
 * stage3 - Kernel page table initialisation for RISC-V
 * anos - An Operating System
 * 
 * Copyright (c) 2025 Ross Bamford
 *
 * This expects that the page-tables are currently the mimimal ones
 * set up by the RISC-V entrypoint code (see 
 * arch/riscv64/entrypoints/limine_entrypoint.c).
 *
 * This doesn't move (or replace entirely) the tables - the PML4,
 * PDPT and PD for the top 2GiB will stay where they are, and will
 * remain the ones that are statically allocated in reserved memory.
 *
 * The entries that map that physical memory to the kernel's VMA will
 * be left alone, since that's where the kernel is going to live (and 
 * where this code is running from, so* changing it would be ... a mistake ðŸ˜…).
 *
 * A new PDPT entry mapping the bottom part of the top PML4 will be added -
 * this is where the PMM stack will live. This is compatible with the 
 * x86_64 layout, see notes in the init_pagetables.c for that arch, and 
 * in the MemoryMap.md, for a few notes on the design and tradeoffs etc.
