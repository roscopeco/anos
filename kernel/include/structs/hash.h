 *
 * This is a basic hash table using open‚Äêaddressing with linear probing.
 * 
 * The FBA is used for allocation. Resizing could be more efficient, but
 * lookup is amortized constant-time and resize should be relatively
 * rare...
 * 
 * TODO this could be significantly improved - it's written for simplicity
 * right now, but really ought to be tuned...
 * 
 * Performance of this isn't _great_ and all operations use spinlocks,
 * so it shouldn't be used for high-contention situations.
