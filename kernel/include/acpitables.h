/*
 * Validate the ACPI tables and map them into virtual memory.
 *
 * The tables will be mapped into the reserved area of virtual
 * address space based at ACPI_TABLES_VADDR_BASE.
 *
 * Currently, the mapping may be relatively sparse, depending
 * how the tables are laid out by the BIOS:
 *
 * * Nothing is copied or moved in physical RAM
 * * The physical addresses are simply mapped into virtual space
 * * Where they are in the same physical page, they'll end up in the same
 * virtual one
 * * But where they are spread around, they'll end up in different virtual pages
 *
 * Caveats:
 *
 * * If a table crosses a page boundary, this will break!
 *   * I don't know if this is a thing (but I bet it can be...)
 * * If more than eight pages need to be mapped, this will error
 * * If this errors, any pages it did map won't be unmapped
 *   * But it's probably a panic at that point anyway, so ðŸ¤·
 *
 * Returns the virtual pointer to the RSDT header. All pointers
 * in this will have been fixed up to their virtual addresses.
 *
 * Pointers in _some_ of the other SDTs will also be fixed - but
 * only the ones I'm actually using right now. More will be added
 * as I need them ðŸ™ƒ
